"The idea is to make a blackjack card game using the deck of cards API (https://deckofcardsapi.com). It should be responsive to work on both desktop and mobile resolutions.

Start screen: The user will have a base deposit of 200â‚¬ (just a value, the user will not play with actual money of course) and can decide how that money is split up in poker chips. 

Play screen: Each round the player is able to bet a certain amount of chips and will either lose their bet or be rewarded if they manage to beat the dealer. All other rules and the full process of the game will follow the blackjack rules.

If the user ever runs out of chips, the game is over. The user can stop playing at any time and will get a score equal to the chips earned."
